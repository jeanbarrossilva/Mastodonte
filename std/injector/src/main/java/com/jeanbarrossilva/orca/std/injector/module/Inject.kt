/**
 * Denotes that the dependency provided by the value of the annotated property should be

 * for getting its result should be created for that same [Module].
 *
 * For example, declaring `class MyModule(@Inject val dependency: Injection<Int>)` and registering
 * it in the [Injector] injects `dependency` into `MyModule` and makes its provided `Int` accessible
 * via a `MyModule.dependency()` extension function.
 *
 * Note that the annotated property should return an [Injection]; otherwise, an error will be thrown
 * at build time.
