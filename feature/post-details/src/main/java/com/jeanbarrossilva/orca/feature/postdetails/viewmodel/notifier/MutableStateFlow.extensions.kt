/**
 * Creates a [MutableStateFlow] to which [Notifier]s are emitted and that has the only purpose of
 * being collected by other [Flow]s, letting them know when it's time for them to emit new values.
 *
 * Notifications can be sent by it through [notify], which will simply emit a [Notifier] that's
 * different from the one currently being held. Because a [StateFlow] doesn't consecutively emit
 * values that are equal, there are two existing [Notifier] instances: [Notifier.initial] and
 * [Notifier.subsequent]; they're emitted interchangeably at each call to that method.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```kotlin
 * val notifierFlow = notifierFlow()
 * val countFlow = notifierFlow.runningFold(0) { count, _ -> count.inc() }
 * repeat(4) { notifierFlow.notify() }
 * countFlow.collect(::println)
 * ```
 *
 * In this case, `countFlow` emits an incremented version of its current value at each notification
 * `notifierFlow` sends, and the result of its collection at the end is the printing of "0", "1",
 * "2" and "3".
 *
 * @see Notifier.next
 * @see Flow.collect
