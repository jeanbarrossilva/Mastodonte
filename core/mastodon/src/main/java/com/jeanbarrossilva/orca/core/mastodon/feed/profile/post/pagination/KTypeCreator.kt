/**
 * Creates a [KType] for [T].
 *
 * Such behavior is necessary because of the generic nature of a [MastodonPostPaginator]: since its
 * type parameter (which is the DTO to be received from the API when pagination takes place) cannot
 * be reified (at least not as of Kotlin 1.9.21), the [HttpResponse] needs to know how to actually
 * convert the payload into the specified object. Tends to result in a somewhat manual process if
 * there are, for example, type arguments that need to be given; otherwise, a default [KTypeCreator]
 * can automatically do the work all by itself.
 *
 * It is primarily taken advantage of by Orca's own implementation of [HttpResponse.body], which
 * takes a [KTypeCreator] in instead of a reified type parameter (as does
 * [io.ktor.client.call.body]).
 *
 * @param T Object for which the [KType] to be created is.
