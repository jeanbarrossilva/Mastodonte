/**
 * Interactions between [Composable]s and the system [View]s are bidirectional by nature, given that
 * the first are declarative and composition-based and, the latter, imperative and callback-based;
 * that results in inconsistencies such as a [Composable] text field being in an invalid or unknown
 * state due to non-sanitized inputs to its backing [EditText], since the `(String) -> Unit`-like
 * on-change callback passed into it is responsible for (possibly) performing validation and
 * (probably) updating the text to be displayed (rather than it being the job of its [View]
 * counterpart).
 *
 * A source of truth aims to mitigate that very issue by validating whether the [View]'s current
 * state matches that of the [Composable] and resetting the [View]'s to that prior to the actual
 * recomposition when they're mismatching.
 *
 * For the corrections to be effectively applied, this source must be attached to both the [View]
 * and the [Composable]. When conformity enforcement is no longer necessary (i. e., when the
 * [AndroidView] gets released), it should then be detached.
