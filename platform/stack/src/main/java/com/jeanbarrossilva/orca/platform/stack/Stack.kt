 * recently being the totally visible one (resembling the behavior of an actual [java.util.Stack]).
 *
 * Realistically, only a certain amount of items will be rendered: the one added lastly (referred to
 * as the "foreground" one) and some of those previous to it (the "background" ones). The exact
 * quantity is determined by [StackMeasurePolicy.MaxVisibleItemCount].
 *
 * For a more detailed explanation on the distinction between foreground and background items and
