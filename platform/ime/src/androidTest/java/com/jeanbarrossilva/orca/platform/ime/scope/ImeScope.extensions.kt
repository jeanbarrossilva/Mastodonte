/**
 * Creates an environment for [Ime]-specific tests.
 *
 * Ultimately, facilitates the process of controlling the visibility of the IME and, most
 * importantly, suspends the execution flow while doing so (that is, until the animation ends). This
 * specific behavior prevents the outdated state in which the IME previously *was* to be obtained as
 * being the current one, which is what would most likely occur if, for example, the following case
 * was to be tested:
 * ```kotlin
 * @Test
 * fun opensIme(windowInsets: WindowInsets, windowInsetsController: WindowInsetsController) {
 *   windowInsetsController.show(Ime.type)
 *   assertThat(windowInsets.isVisible(Ime.type)).isTrue()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * With the [ImeScope] that is provided to the [body] of this method, calls to both [ImeScope.open]
 * and [ImeScope.close] gracefully wait for the animations to end and provide the most up-to-date
 * visibility when it is later retrieved. What was done in the previous example could successfully
 * be achieved as:
 * ```kotlin
 * @Test
 * fun opensIme() {
 *   runImeTest {
 *     open()
 *     assertThat(ime.isOpen).isTrue()
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param body Testing to be performed.
 * @see WindowInsets
 * @see WindowInsetsController
 * @see Ime.type
 * @see WindowInsetsController.show
 * @see WindowInsets.isVisible
 * @see ImeScope.ime
